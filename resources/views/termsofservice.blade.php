        <h1>üìú Terms of Service of FastThread Mercantile</h1>
        <p><em>A Treatise Concerning the Regulation of Transactions, the Propriety of Customer Behaviour, and the Occasional Disappointment in Fabric Quality</em></p>

        <h2>I. Preface to the Honourable Guest</h2>
        <p>By perusing, engaging with, or so much as scrolling through this illustrious website‚ÄîFastThread Mercantile, Proud Importers of Apparel at Vaguely Unbelievable Prices‚Äîthou entereth a mutually binding understanding, hereafter referred to as ‚ÄúThe Grand Pact of Clicketh and Regret.‚Äù</p>

        <h2>II. The Nature of the Goods</h2>
        <p>The wares thou shalt encounter in this repository of fashion are manufactured with great haste and minimal oversight in the industrious precincts of China. The quality, whilst ostensibly ‚Äútextile,‚Äù may vary in spirit and stitching. Descriptions and images are for "interpretative inspiration only." If the sleeves are not entirely sleeve-like, consider it an avant-garde statement.</p>

        <h2>III. Sizing: A Game of Numerical Roulette</h2>
        <p>The sizing chart is an <strong>aspirational document</strong>, a whisper of geometry and optimism. Thy idea of "Large" may, in our system, be "Petite Spectral Toddler." Thou art advised to consult a tape measure, an oracle, and perhaps a friend.</p>

        <h2>IV. Payment: Coin for Cloth</h2>
        <p>Thou shalt render unto us monetary compensation in exchange for the aforementioned goods. The transaction is considered holy and irreversible, barring delivery of an item bearing no resemblance to its digital effigy.</p>

        <h2>V. Shipping: The Waiting Ritual</h2>
        <p>Thine order shall embark upon a noble journey. Estimated delivery is between 7 and 30 business days. It is, as they say, on a journey of self-discovery.</p>

        <h2>VI. Returns and the Myth of Satisfaction</h2>
        <p>Should thy item be grievously malformed or otherwise unusable in polite society, thou may submit a request for return. Minor displeasure or colour discrepancy shall not constitute grounds for refund.</p>

        <h2>VII. Conduct of the Noble Patron</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Speaketh with civility;</li>
            <li>Refrain from excessive threats over modest sums;</li>
            <li>Use not ALL CAPS when invoking our support spirits;</li>
            <li>Accept that thou art not purchasing heirlooms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>VIII. Privacy: The Gentle Peering of Our Database</h2>
        <p>We collect that which thou freely givest. No villainous exchange of data occurs. Thy secrets remain as guarded as our backend allows.</p>

        <h2>IX. Disputes: When Swords Must Be Sheathed</h2>
        <p>Disagreements shall be settled with decorum. In extreme cases, thou may be referred to a tribunal of support agents (or Darren, if he is working that day).</p>

        <h2>X. The Final Click</h2>
        <p>By proceeding, thou affirmest understanding, or at least mild awareness, of the terms. Thou shalt not rage should thy trousers arrive resembling curtains.</p>

        <p><em>Go now, noble shopper, and may thy parcels be swift and thy seams mostly intact.</em></p>
